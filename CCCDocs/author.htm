projectName = Cross-Cutting Concerns (primarily logging)
author = Is designed to encapsulated common cross-cutting concerns (logging, exception handling, etc.). Often times cross-cutting concerns are an after-thought; or, hastily injected without any ability to manage or control. This project was to encapsulate those concerns and provide a mechanism to change/augment. Changing behaviour is a matter of inheritance and specifying choice via custom metadata.
