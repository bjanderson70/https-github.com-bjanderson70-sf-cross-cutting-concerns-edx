# sf-cross-cutting-concerns-edx
Cross cutting concerns for apex code..

This code designed to encapsulate common cross-cutting concerns (logging, exception handling, caching, etc.).Often times cross-cutting concerns are an after-thought; or, hastily injected without any ability to manage or control.This project was to encapsulate those concerns and provide a mechanism to change/augment. 
Changing behaviour is a matter of inheritance and specifying choice via custom metadata. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/bjanderson70/sf-cross-cutting-concerns/wiki) for more informaiton.
